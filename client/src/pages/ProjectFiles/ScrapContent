          <h2>Security: Protecting Our Digital Frontier</h2>

          <h3>Cyber Incident: A Critical Learning Moment</h3>
          <p>
            In an unexpected turn of events, our website faced a critical security vulnerability—one that reshaped our approach to cybersecurity. Here's a detailed look at the incident:
          </p>

          <p><strong>The Incident:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What Happened:</strong> Our team developed and deployed the website to handle hackathon registrations and payments. Due to a tight schedule, security was initially deprioritized. We disabled Row Level Security (RLS) in the Supabase backend to speed up data entry, leaving the database exposed to unauthorized changes.</li>
            <li><strong>How We Discovered It:</strong> After deployment, a participant noticed the exposed database and alerted us. They demonstrated the vulnerability by adding an empty row, highlighting the potential for unauthorized CRUD operations.</li>
            <li><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong> We quickly re-enabled RLS with custom rules, tested the changes on a dummy site, and then deployed the fix to the live site. This experience reinforced the importance of prioritizing security from the start, no matter the project scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Never compromise on security, even for seemingly low-risk projects</li>
            <li>Implement strong security measures like RLS and key protection early in development</li>
            <li>Regularly audit systems for vulnerabilities, even after deployment</li>
          </ul>
